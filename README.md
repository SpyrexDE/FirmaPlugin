# FirmaPlugin
Firma offers players to found their own or join someone's Company. When the player mines ores in a specific world, they can sell them through an inventory giving them gems in exchange. Those gems can be used by the company leader to upgrade the tools given to the workers. The plugin offers extensive inventory GUIs with animations and customizability.

This was my first big Java project and probably the most important one for my education in programming.
